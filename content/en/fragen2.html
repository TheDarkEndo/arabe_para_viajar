<p></ul><b>Whenever I try to listen to the native speakers the computer wants me to save the audio files to disk! </b><p><ul>
  
Please check your media player's settings to see if it it automatically opens .wav files. If this is not the case you should make the necessary adjustments. The media player should now automatically play the audio files.
  <p>
You may use any player, e.g. the Wondows Media Player but we would recommend the <a href=http://www.real.com target=real>RealPlayer</a> as it works as a background appliance and will not interfere with your studying.

<p></ul><b>My media player blocks my view of the texts!</b><p><ul>

There are two different icons for the audio play, an arrow and a speaker. You should try which one works best on your computer. Since the language course works on different operating systems two different possibilities have been included. If neither option should ensure that you get a clear view of your browser window you may check one of the following options.:
<p>
Option No.1: Installing a different media player. The Windows Media Player, WinAmp, the RealPlayer and many other players will work under Windows.
<p>
Option No.2: Try moving the media player to the edge of your screen until he does not obstruct your view anymore. It will continue to pop up with every file you listen to but it will not open in a central position.
<p>
Option No.3: Try using a different Web-browser to work with the language course. Each browser will deal with audio files in a different way. At the moment there are a lot of options available such as for example the Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla or Firefox to name only a few.
<p>
Option no.4: There are two different icons for the audio play, an arrow and a speaker. Try to use the other symbol to see if it works.
