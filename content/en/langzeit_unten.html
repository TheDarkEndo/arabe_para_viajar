How to work with the long term memory test

<strong>This is how words are stored in your long term memory</strong><p>

This learning technique will help you memorise all the words on the language course. Each day, you will be tested on a certain amount of new words. You are free to choose how many new words the test should include.<p>
The prgramme will register all the words that you get right first time. Once you have got a word right for the fifth day in a row it will be deleted from the list of words that you are tested on as you have proved that it has been stored in your long term memory.<br>The same happens to the words that you got right from the very beginning. This makes it even quicker to revise the things that you have learned earlier.



<p><strong>How to start the test:</strong><p>

There are two different possibilities to start the test. If you want to start from the very beginning you should choose the amount of words that you wish to learn every day. If you have got between half an hour and an hour a day to study you should pick a number of words between 20 and 30.<p>
If you have already started the test and have been given a continuation code you can pick up from where you left off.


<p><strong>After taking the test:</strong><p>

After taking the test you will be given a code that will allow you to carry on the next day (or whenever you feel like it). The code contains all the words that you are tested on including information on how often you got them right. (As soon as you got a word right for the fifth time in a row, thus proving that it has been stored in your long term memory, it will be replaced by a new word).<br>
You can select the code (by pressing CTRL+a), copy it (CTRL+c) and paste it to a word processing device (CTRL+v) where you can save it to a file.  <br>
The code will also be saved to your disk as a cookie.
